## What can be done to improve the project:
  * UI wise it's very simple and needs alot of work.
  * PG connection needs to be a POOL instead of a single client.
  * All config should be in external files that are env based.
  * Unit and integration tests are needed for any project with a payment option.
  * The way it's setup it doesn't allow to easily add localization.
